/**
 * Event recorder provides interface for collecting statistics for certain events
 * (e.g. it can be plugged in for monitoring message publications in news feed)
 * Events can be recorded asynchronously in any moment of time.
 * The load may be as high as 10 000 events in second, or only 2 events in hour.
 * Event recorder does not provide interface for event storage or detailed statistics on events.
 *
 * Records array structure has following logic rules:
 * 1) it is filled with entities, one for each second of "last" 24 hours
 * 2) each entity contains: counter for number of events happened in that second,
 *                          time when counter was reset last time,
 *                          to determine if counter was updated more than 24 hours ago
 * 3) if less than 24 hours has passed, events with same-second time increment certain entities counter
 * 4) if more than 24 hours has passed, old value in entities counter is reset
 * 5) thus, records always contain full picture for events in last 24 hours
